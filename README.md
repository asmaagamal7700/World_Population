# World_Population
The world’s population continues to grow, but the pace of growth is slowing down. 
The world’s population is projected to reach 8 billion on 15 November 2022.
Population growth is caused in part by declining levels of mortality, as reflected in increased levels of life expectancy at birth. 
Globally, life expectancy reached 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of almost 9 years since 1990. Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.2 years globally in 2050 .
We'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a 
compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth, and 
explore how the world population spreads across different 
countries
